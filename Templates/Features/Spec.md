# Feature Specification: ${FEATURE_NAME}

**Feature Branch**: `feature/${FEATURE_BRANCH}`  
**Created**: ${SETUP_DATE}  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: ${USER_DESCRIPTION}

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Apply iOS/macOS constitutional principles
   → Accessibility-first design mandatory
   → Privacy by design enforced  
   → Platform UX guidelines required
3. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
   → Consider platform-specific patterns (iPhone, iPad, Mac)
4. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific iOS/macOS question]
   → Common gaps: user auth method, data persistence, platform targets
5. Generate iOS/macOS user scenarios
   → Include accessibility scenarios (VoiceOver, Switch Control)
   → Account for different screen sizes and orientations
   → Consider multi-platform usage patterns
6. Create functional requirements with iOS/macOS context
   → Privacy manifest considerations embedded
   → App Store review guidelines compliance checked
   → Platform-specific capabilities assessed (CloudKit, HealthKit, etc.)
7. Run iOS/macOS validation gates
   → App Store compliance check
   → Privacy impact assessment
   → Accessibility requirement verification
   → Localization readiness review
8. Anti-speculation enforcement
   → No "nice to have" features without clear user value
   → Each feature must solve specific problem
   → Implementation cost vs benefit considered
9. Self-validation checklist execution
   → All mandatory sections complete
   → No ambiguous requirements remain
   → Constitutional principles satisfied
10. Return: SUCCESS (iOS/macOS spec ready for technical planning)

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers
- 🍎 iOS/macOS platform conventions and constitutional principles enforced

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "user authentication" without method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **iOS/macOS specifics**: Consider platform differences, device capabilities, App Store requirements
5. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User authentication method (Apple ID, email/password, OAuth)
   - Data persistence approach (local CoreData, CloudKit sync, both)
   - Target platforms (iOS only, universal, macOS specific)
   - Performance targets and scale expectations
   - Privacy data usage and collection policies
   - Accessibility requirements beyond basic compliance
   - Localization scope and target languages
   - Integration requirements with platform services

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a ${PRIMARY_USER_TYPE}, I want to ${PRIMARY_USER_GOAL} so that ${PRIMARY_USER_BENEFIT}.

**iOS/macOS Context**: 
- Accessibility: How does this work with VoiceOver, Switch Control, or Assistive Touch?
- Multi-platform: How does the experience differ between iPhone, iPad, and Mac?
- Privacy: What personal data is involved and how is user consent obtained?

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** ${SCENARIO_CONTEXT}, **When** ${USER_ACTION}, **Then** ${EXPECTED_OUTCOME}
   - **Happy Path**: Normal successful usage
   - **Error Path**: What happens when things go wrong
   - **Accessibility Path**: How assistive technologies interact
   - **Privacy Path**: User data protection and consent flows

2. **Given** ${SCENARIO_CONTEXT_2}, **When** ${USER_ACTION_2}, **Then** ${EXPECTED_OUTCOME_2}
   - Include different device contexts (iPhone, iPad, Mac)
   - Consider different user capabilities and preferences
   - Account for network conditions and offline scenarios

### Edge Cases
- **Platform variations**: iPhone vs iPad vs Mac specific behaviors
- **Accessibility scenarios**: VoiceOver navigation, voice control, reduced motion
- **Privacy edge cases**: User denies permissions, data export requests, account deletion
- **Multi-device usage**: Handoff, Continuity, CloudKit sync conflicts
- **App lifecycle**: Background processing, memory pressure, system interruptions
- **Localization**: Right-to-left languages, different date/number formats, cultural differences

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Review and customize these placeholder requirements]**

- **FR-001**: System MUST ${REQUIREMENT_1}
- **FR-002**: System MUST ${REQUIREMENT_2}
- **FR-003**: System MUST ${REQUIREMENT_3}

*Each requirement must be:*
- Testable with clear success/failure criteria
- Platform-appropriate for iOS/macOS conventions
- Accessibility-compliant from day one
- Privacy-respectful by design
- Localizable without code changes

### iOS/macOS Constitutional Gates (Constitutional Validation)

#### Privacy by Design Gate (Constitutional Principle I)
- [ ] Privacy manifest impact assessed for any data collection/storage?
- [ ] User consent flows designed for all personal data usage?
- [ ] Data minimization principle applied (collect only what's needed)?
- [ ] User data export and deletion capabilities planned?

#### Accessibility-First Gate (Constitutional Principle II)  
- [ ] VoiceOver labels and hints specified for all UI elements?
- [ ] Dynamic Type support planned for all text content?
- [ ] Color contrast requirements met (4.5:1 minimum)?
- [ ] Keyboard navigation flow defined for all interactions?
- [ ] Switch Control compatibility considered for all gestures?

#### Localizability Gate (Constitutional Principle III)
- [ ] All user-facing text identified for TranslateKit integration?

- [ ] Cultural appropriateness assessed for content and imagery?

#### Platform UX Gate (Constitutional Principle IV)
- [ ] Human Interface Guidelines compliance verified?
- [ ] Platform-specific interaction patterns followed?

- [ ] Implementation cost estimated and approved?
- [ ] Maintenance burden considered and acceptable?

### Scope Boundaries
- **IN SCOPE**: [Specific features with clear user value and constitutional compliance]
- **OUT OF SCOPE**: [Explicitly exclude tempting but unnecessary features]
- **FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS**: [Ideas for later that shouldn't be implemented now]

### Anti-Speculation Enforcement
- [ ] No speculative or "future-proofing" features included?
- [ ] Each feature tied to current user needs, not hypothetical scenarios?
- [ ] Feature set focused on core value proposition?
- [ ] Complexity intentionally constrained to essential functionality?
