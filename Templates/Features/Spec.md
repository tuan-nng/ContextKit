════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ 🤖 EXECUTION FLOW - FEATURE SPECIFICATION GENERATION
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║
║ ## Execution Flow (main)
║
║ ### Phase 1: Context Analysis & Guidelines Loading
║
║ 1. **Load Project Context**
║    - Use `Read` tool to read project Context.md: `Read Context.md`
║    - Extract project type, tech stack, development patterns, workspace reference
║    - Document project context for specification customization
║
║ 2. **Load Development Guidelines**
║    - Based on project type detected from Context.md:
║      - If Swift detected: Use `Read` tool: `Read Context/Guidelines/Swift.md`
║      - If SwiftUI detected: Use `Read` tool: `Read Context/Guidelines/SwiftUI.md`
║      - If other languages detected: Look for workspace-specific guidelines in Context/Guidelines/
║    - For workspace projects: Use `Read` tool on workspace Context.md for additional standards
║    - Document loaded guidelines for development pattern application
║
║ 3. **Extract User Requirements from Original Input**
║    - Parse original feature description provided by user
║    - Identify key concepts: primary functionality, user actors, data involved, platform targets
║    - Generate initial understanding of user needs and business value
║
║ ### Phase 2: Specification Content Generation
║
║ 4. **Generate Feature Information**
║    - Use `Edit` tool to replace template header with specific feature information:
║      - Title: "# Feature Specification: [Feature Name]"
║      - Feature Branch: `feature/[kebab-case-name]` (from parent command)
║      - Created: [Current Date]
║      - Status: Draft
║      - Input: [Original user description]
║
║ 5. **Create Primary User Story**
║    - Generate "As a [User Type], I want to [User Goal] so that [User Benefit]"
║    - Include platform-specific context (iOS/macOS considerations)
║    - Add multi-platform context sections
║
║ 6. **Generate Acceptance Scenarios**
║    - Create comprehensive Given/When/Then scenarios
║    - Include Happy Path, Error Path, Edge Cases
║    - Add device-specific scenarios (iPhone, iPad, Mac)
║    - Consider network conditions and offline scenarios
║
║ 7. **Define Functional Requirements**
║    - Generate specific, testable requirements (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
║    - Each requirement must be:
║      - Testable with clear success/failure criteria
║      - Platform-appropriate for iOS/macOS conventions
║      - User-focused and business-value driven
║
║ ### Phase 3: Business Validation & Scope Definition
║
║ 8. **Focus on Business Value**
║    - Keep specification focused on user needs and business requirements
║    - Avoid technical implementation details (frameworks, APIs, code structure)
║    - Document what users need, not how to build it
║
║ 9. **Feature Justification & Scope Definition**
║    - Fill Value Validation section: user problem, success metrics, cost/benefit
║    - Define clear scope boundaries:
║      - IN SCOPE: Specific features with clear user value
║      - OUT OF SCOPE: Exclude unnecessary features
║      - FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS: Ideas for later phases
║    - Apply anti-speculation enforcement (check all relevant boxes)
║
║ 10. **Mark Clarification Needs**
║     - For any ambiguous or underspecified requirements, mark with:
║       [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
║     - Common areas: authentication methods, data persistence, target platforms,
║       performance targets, user flows, business requirements
║
║ ### Phase 4: Validation & Completion
║
║ 11. **Execute Business Validation Gates**
║     - User Value: Clear user problems solved, measurable success criteria
║     - Scope Clarity: Well-defined boundaries, no feature creep
║     - Testability: Requirements can be validated with clear pass/fail criteria
║     - Quality Assurance: Complete user flows, edge cases, measurable criteria
║
║ 12. **Template Quality Validation**
║     - Content Quality: No implementation details, focused on user value, stakeholder-appropriate
║     - Requirement Completeness: Testable requirements, clear scope, identified dependencies
║     - Business Focus: Requirements focused on what users need, not how to build it
║     - Check all boxes in template validation section
║
║ 13. **Update Execution Status**
║     - Check off all completed execution status items:
║       - User description parsed
║       - Development guidelines applied
║       - Key concepts extracted
║       - Ambiguities marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
║       - Platform-specific user scenarios defined
║       - Platform-specific requirements generated
║       - Anti-speculation enforcement applied
║       - Validation gates executed
║       - Template self-validation completed
║       - Review checklist passed
║
║ 14. **COMPLETION**
║     - Use `Edit` tool to remove this entire boxed system instructions section
║     - Leave only the clean feature specification content for team use
║     - Final document focused on business requirements, not generation process
║
║ ## Success Criteria
║ - All specification sections completed with specific, project-appropriate content
║ - Development guidelines from loaded standards properly applied throughout
║ - Requirements are specific, testable, and unambiguous with clear success criteria
║ - Platform considerations (iOS/macOS) integrated throughout specification
║ - User value clearly articulated without technical implementation details
║ - All validation gates passed and checkboxes marked appropriately
║ - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers used for genuine ambiguities only
║ - System instructions completely removed from final specification document

**Command Arguments Used**:
- `$ARGUMENTS` - Original user input (e.g., "Add user authentication with Apple ID")
- AI generates feature name from `$ARGUMENTS` (e.g., "UserAuthentication")
- AI creates kebab-case branch name (e.g., "user-authentication") 
- AI fills in current date and extracts user story components
