## For AI Generation

When creating this technical plan from a feature specification:

1. **Analyze the specification thoroughly**: Extract all technical implications from user scenarios and requirements
2. **Apply constitutional gates rigorously**: Don't compromise on package-first, ErrorKit, or quality standards without explicit justification  
3. **Make architectural decisions explicit**: Document why you chose specific approaches and what alternatives you considered
4. **Be realistic about complexity**: Don't underestimate implementation effort or overlook potential risks
5. **Focus on iOS/macOS excellence**: Leverage platform-specific capabilities and follow platform conventions
6. **Mark genuine uncertainties**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] for technical questions that require domain expertise or user preference
7. **Validate completeness**: Ensure the technical plan addresses every requirement from the specification

### Common Technical Pitfalls to Avoid
- Over-engineering solutions when simple approaches would work
- Ignoring constitutional principles without proper justification
- Making assumptions about external dependencies or API availability  
- Underestimating integration complexity with existing code
- Forgetting platform-specific requirements (accessibility, privacy, App Store)
- Creating technical debt through shortcuts or temporary solutions

### Quality Checklist Before Completion
- [ ] Every specification requirement has a technical solution
- [ ] All architectural decisions include rationale  
- [ ] Constitutional compliance verified at every level
- [ ] Complexity assessment includes realistic time estimates
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies defined for high-risk areas
- [ ] Integration with existing codebase carefully planned
- [ ] Platform guidelines and best practices incorporated

**IMPORTANT**: This technical plan should provide sufficient detail for systematic task breakdown while remaining focused on architectural decisions rather than implementation minutiae. Detailed code examples and extensive technical specifications should be deferred to Phase 2 implementation planning.
