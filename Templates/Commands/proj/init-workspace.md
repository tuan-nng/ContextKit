## Description
Initialize workspace-level context configuration. Copies workspace template and executes interactive setup for multi-project workspace standards.

## Execution Flow (main)

**User Question Format**: When asking user questions, use this consistent format:
```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ ❓ [DESCRIPTIVE HEADER]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
║
║ [Question text and context]
║ [Options if applicable]
║
║ [Clear response instruction]
```

### Phase 0: Check Customization

0. **Read the "👩‍💻 DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATIONS" section**
   - Use `Grep` tool to find the start of the section
   - Read everything below that line contained in this document til the end of the file
   - Make sure to consider what was said there with high priority
   - If anything conflicts with the rest of the workflow, prioritize the "developer customizations"

### Phase 1: Workspace Status Check

1. **Check Existing Workspace Setup**
   - Use `Glob` tool to find existing Context.md: `Glob . Context.md`
   - If `Context.md` exists:
     ```
     🎉 Workspace already initialized with ContextKit!

     ✅ Context.md contains workspace configuration and inheritance rules
     ✅ All projects in this workspace inherit workspace standards

     💡 No action needed. To modify workspace settings, edit Context.md directly
        or use @ctxk:proj:migrate to update to newer ContextKit version.

     🔗 Next Steps:
     • Navigate to a project directory within this workspace
     • Run @ctxk:proj:init to setup ContextKit in that project (inherits workspace config)
     • Begin your first feature with @ctxk:plan:1-spec
     ```
     → END (exit successfully)

2. **Verify ContextKit Global Installation**
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.ContextKit/Templates/Contexts/Workspace.md || echo "❌ ContextKit not installed globally. Run: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlineDev/ContextKit/main/install.sh | sh"
   ```

### Phase 2: Template Installation & Execution

3. **Copy Workspace Template**
   ```bash
   cp ~/.ContextKit/Templates/Contexts/Workspace.md Context.md
   echo "✅ Copied workspace context template"
   ```

4. **Collect User Preferences for Workspace Configuration**
   - **Workspace Type Selection**: Ask user: "What type of workspace is this?"
     1. Personal/Indie Development
     2. Client/Contract Work
     3. Enterprise/Company
     4. Open Source Project
   - **Follow-up Details**: Based on selection, ask follow-up questions:
     - Client/Enterprise: Ask for company name
     - All types: Ask for brief workspace description
   - **Coding Standards**: Ask user: "Override indentation preference for this workspace?"
     1. Keep current/detected patterns
     2. Standardize on 3 spaces
     3. Standardize on 2 spaces
     4. Standardize on 4 spaces
     5. Standardize on tabs
   - **Development Principles**: For Client/Enterprise workspaces, ask: "Any client requirements that override default principles (accessibility, privacy, localizability, maintainability, platform UX)?"
   - **Configuration Summary**: Display all collected preferences to user for confirmation

5. **Execute Context.md Template Instructions with User Preferences**
   - Use `Read` tool to read the copied `Context.md` file
   - Follow the **system instructions** section (boxed area) step by step
   - Pass collected user preferences to template execution
   - The template performs DEEP analysis of ALL repositories in the workspace:
     - Recursive git repository discovery (including submodules and nested repos)
     - README analysis for project purpose detection
     - Build file analysis for tech stack detection (Package.swift, package.json, etc.)
     - Actual code style detection from formatter configs and source files
     - Complete dependency analysis across all projects
   - Use tools (`Bash`, `Glob`, `Read`, `Grep`, `Edit`) as directed by template
   - **At completion**: Use `Edit` tool to remove the system instructions section entirely

6. **Display Success Message**
   ```
   🎉 Workspace initialization complete!

   ✅ Context.md created with comprehensive repository analysis
   ✅ Hierarchical repository structure mapped with tech stacks and purposes
   ✅ Technology patterns and dependencies detected across all projects
   ✅ Project inheritance hierarchy established

   📊 Analysis Results:
   • [X] repositories discovered and analyzed
   • [Y] different technology stacks identified
   • [Z] common dependencies found across projects

   🔗 Next Steps:
   • Navigate to individual project directories to run @ctxk:proj:init
   • Each project will inherit these workspace standards
   • Begin your first feature with @ctxk:plan:1-spec

   💡 Commit Context.md to version control for team collaboration.

   🧠 ContextKit workspace ready with complete repository understanding!
   ```

## Error Conditions

- **"ContextKit not installed globally"** → Run installation: `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FlineDev/ContextKit/main/install.sh | sh`
- **"Workspace template not found"** → Check global ContextKit installation integrity
- **"Template copy failed"** → Check directory permissions and disk space
- **"Template execution failed"** → Verify Context.md template contains system instructions section

## Validation Gates

- ContextKit globally installed and accessible?
- Workspace not already initialized (no existing Context.md)?
- Workspace template successfully copied to Context.md?
- Complete repository discovery executed (all git repos found recursively)?
- Each repository analyzed for purpose, tech stack, and dependencies?
- Hierarchical repository structure generated with accurate relationships?
- Technology findings based on actual file analysis, not assumptions?
- Code style detection performed on actual source files and formatter configs?
- Template system instructions executed successfully?
- System instructions section removed from final Context.md?

## Integration Points

- **Global ContextKit**: Uses Templates/Contexts/Workspace.md template
- **Project Setup**: Provides workspace inheritance for @ctxk:proj:init command
- **Team Collaboration**: Creates committed Context.md for team consistency
- **Development Workflow**: Establishes workspace standards for all ContextKit commands
