## Description
Execute NPM package release workflow with version management, release notes generation, and GitHub integration.

## Parameters
**Usage**: `@ctxk:impl:release-package [version]`
- `version` (optional): Specific version like "1.2.0" or "major"/"minor"/"patch" for semantic bumping

## Execution Flow (main)

### Phase 0: Check Customization

0. **Read the "üë©‚Äçüíª DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATIONS" section**
   - Use `Grep` tool to find the start of the section
   - Read everything below that line contained in this document til the end of the file
   - Make sure to consider what was said there with high priority
   - If anything conflicts with the rest of the workflow, prioritize the "developer customizations"

### Phase 1: Prerequisites Validation

1. **Verify NPM Package Project**
   ```bash
   ls package.json || echo "‚ùå Not an NPM package project"
   ```
   - If package.json not found: ERROR "This command is for NPM packages. package.json is required."

2. **Check Git Repository Status**
   ```bash
   git status --porcelain
   ```
   - If uncommitted changes exist: ERROR "Uncommitted changes detected. Commit all changes before release."
   - If not in git repository: ERROR "Git repository required for package releases."

3. **Validate Package Builds and Tests**
   - Check if build script exists in package.json
   - Run build command from Context.md if available
   - Run test command: `npm test` or equivalent from Context.md
   - If build fails: ERROR "Package must build successfully before release."
   - If tests fail: ERROR "All tests must pass before release."

4. **Check NPM Authentication**
   ```bash
   npm whoami || echo "‚ùå Not logged in to NPM"
   ```
   - If not authenticated: ERROR "Run 'npm login' to authenticate with NPM registry."

5. **Check GitHub CLI Access (Optional)**
   ```bash
   gh auth status || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  GitHub CLI not authenticated (optional for release notes)"
   ```
   - If not authenticated: WARN "GitHub CLI authentication recommended for automated release notes."

### Phase 2: Version Management

5. **Extract Package Information**
   - Use `Read` tool to read package.json: `Read package.json`
   - Parse package name from `name` field
   - Parse current version from `version` field
   - Determine repository URL from git remote: `git remote get-url origin`

6. **Determine Current Version and Get User Input**
   - Current version from package.json
   - Latest git tag: `git tag --list --sort=-version:refname | head -1`
   - If versions don't match: WARN "package.json version differs from latest git tag"

7. **Comprehensive Change Analysis Since Last Release**
   **Step 7a: Commit Message Analysis**
   ```bash
   git log [LAST_TAG]..HEAD --oneline
   ```
   - Count commits since last release
   - Look for conventional commit patterns (feat:, fix:, BREAKING:)

   **Step 7b: File Change Analysis**
   ```bash
   git diff --name-status [LAST_TAG]..HEAD
   ```
   - Identify added (A), modified (M), deleted (D), renamed (R) files
   - Categorize files by type: Sources/, Tests/, package.json, README.md, etc.

   **Step 7c: Code Diff Analysis**
   ```bash
   git diff [LAST_TAG]..HEAD
   ```
   - Analyze actual code changes line by line
   - Focus on public API changes in Sources/ directory
   - Examine package.json for dependency changes
   - Check README.md and documentation updates

8. **User Input for Version Number**
   - Analyze changes from step 7 to suggest version bump type:
     - **MAJOR**: If breaking changes detected (public API removals, signature changes)
     - **MINOR**: If new features added (new public APIs, significant functionality)
     - **PATCH**: If only bug fixes, documentation, internal improvements, performance optimizations

   - Use User Input Format to ask for version selection
   - Show package name, repository, current version, commit count, and suggested bump type with reasoning
   - Accept specific version (e.g., "1.2.0") or bump type ("major"/"minor"/"patch")
   - Parse and validate version format
   - If bump type provided: calculate from current version

### Phase 3: Release Notes Generation

9. **Analyze Changes and Generate Release Notes**
   **Step 9a: Review Conversation Context**
   - Analyze current chat conversation for work performed and context
   - Understand the intent behind changes made during this development session
   - Cross-reference with git changes to ensure accuracy

   **Step 9b: Comprehensive Change Analysis**
   Use the comprehensive change analysis from step 7 to systematically review each change:

   **For each modified file, examine the actual code changes and categorize:**

   **INCLUDE in release notes:**
   ‚úÖ New public APIs or features users can access
   ‚úÖ Bug fixes that affect user experience
   ‚úÖ Performance improvements users will notice
   ‚úÖ Breaking changes requiring user action
   ‚úÖ New dependencies or platform requirements
   ‚úÖ Security improvements
   ‚úÖ Improved error messages or error handling
   ‚úÖ Documentation updates that help users

   **EXCLUDE from release notes:**
   ‚ùå Internal refactoring with no user impact
   ‚ùå Test-only changes (unless they indicate new features being tested)
   ‚ùå Code formatting or style changes
   ‚ùå Internal helper methods or private implementations
   ‚ùå Development tooling changes (unless affecting package consumers)
   ‚ùå Commit message fixes or typos in non-user-facing text

   **Step 9c: Generate Simple Release Notes List**
   - Create a simple list of bullet points (no file created)
   - Sort by Keep A Changelog order: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
   - Within each type, sort by importance (most impactful first)
   - Start each point with the action word: "Added", "Fixed", "Changed", etc.
   - Write user-focused descriptions explaining the benefit
   - If no meaningful user-facing changes found: Ask "Create maintenance release anyway?"

10. **Iterate on Release Notes with User Feedback**
    - Display generated release notes as simple bullet list
    - Use User Input Format to ask: "Use these release notes? (Y/n/r to revise - tell me what to change)"
    - **Y**: Continue with generated notes
    - **n**: Skip release notes (create release without notes)
    - **r**: Revise - ask user for specific improvement requests, then regenerate

    **If user chooses "r" (revise):**
    - Prompt: "How should I improve these release notes? Examples:"
      - "Make the API changes point more specific and include code example"
      - "Combine the performance improvements into one clearer point"
      - "Add more detail about the breaking changes and migration steps"
      - "Use more user-friendly language, less technical"
      - "Reorder by importance - put the new features first"
    - Take user feedback and regenerate improved version
    - Repeat Y/n/r cycle until user approves or skips

### Phase 4: Build Verification and Version Update

11. **Update Version in package.json**
    ```bash
    npm version [NEW_VERSION] --no-git-tag-version
    ```
    - Updates version field in package.json
    - Commit this change: `git commit -am "Bump version to [NEW_VERSION]"`

12. **Build Package for Distribution**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    - Run build script from package.json
    - Verify dist/ or build/ directory created
    - If build fails: ERROR "Fix build errors before release" ‚Üí EXIT

### Phase 5: Publish and GitHub Release

13. **Create Git Tag and Push**
    ```bash
    git tag -a "v[NEW_VERSION]" -m "Release [NEW_VERSION]"
    git push origin main --tags
    ```
    - Push both commits and new tag

14. **Publish to NPM**
    ```bash
    npm publish
    ```
    - For scoped packages: `npm publish --access public`
    - If publish fails: ERROR "NPM publish failed. Check authentication and permissions."

15. **Create GitHub Release (if gh available)**
    ```bash
    gh release create "v[NEW_VERSION]" --title "[PACKAGE_NAME] [NEW_VERSION]" --notes "[FORMATTED_RELEASE_NOTES]"
    ```
    - If gh not available: SKIP and note to create manually

16. **Verify Release**
    ```bash
    npm view [PACKAGE_NAME] version
    ```
    - Confirm new version appears on NPM
    - Provide NPM package URL: `https://www.npmjs.com/package/[PACKAGE_NAME]`

### Phase 6: Success Confirmation

17. **Display Success Message** (see Success Message section below)

## Error Conditions

- **"package.json not found"** ‚Üí This command is for NPM packages. Use `@ctxk:impl:release-app` for iOS/macOS apps
- **"Uncommitted changes"** ‚Üí Commit all changes with `git add . && git commit -m "message"` before release
- **"Build failed"** ‚Üí Fix compilation errors before attempting release
- **"Tests failed"** ‚Üí All tests must pass before release. Fix failing tests first
- **"GitHub CLI not authenticated"** ‚Üí Run `gh auth login` to authenticate with GitHub
