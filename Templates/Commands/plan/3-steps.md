## Description
Generate implementation task breakdown by detecting current feature, validating prerequisites, copying steps template, and executing template workflow with S### task enumeration and parallel execution planning.

## User Input Format

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ ❓ USER INPUT REQUIRED - [Topic]
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
║
║ [Question and context]
║
║ [Response instruction]
```

## Execution Flow (main)

### Phase 0: Check Customization

0. **Read the "👩‍💻 DEVELOPER CUSTOMIZATIONS" section**
   - Use `Grep` tool to find the start of the section
   - Read everything below that line contained in this document til the end of the file
   - Make sure to consider what was said there with high priority
   - If anything conflicts with the rest of the workflow, prioritize the "developer customizations"

### Phase 1: Setup Validation & Prerequisites

1. **Check Project Setup**
   - Use `Glob` tool to verify Context.md exists: `Glob . Context.md`
   - If Context.md missing:
     ```
     ❌ ContextKit not initialized in this project!

     Run @ctxk:proj:init first to setup ContextKit in this project.
     This command requires project context to detect tech stack and apply
     appropriate development guidelines.
     ```
     → END (exit with error)

### Phase 2: Feature Detection & Validation

2. **Detect Current Feature**
   - Use `Bash` tool to check current git branch: `git branch --show-current`
   - If on feature/[prefix]-[name] branch: Extract feature name from branch
   - If not on feature branch: Ask user which feature to work on using consistent format
   - Use `Glob` tool to find numbered feature directory: `Glob Context/Features/???-[FeatureName]`

3. **Validate Prerequisites**
   - Use `Read` tool to check Spec.md exists in the found numbered directory: `Read [numbered-feature-directory]/Spec.md`
   - Use `Read` tool to check Tech.md exists in the found numbered directory: `Read [numbered-feature-directory]/Tech.md`
   - Use `Read` tool to check Research.md exists in the found numbered directory: `Read [numbered-feature-directory]/Research.md`
   - If any missing:
     ```
     ❌ Prerequisites not complete!

     All planning phases are required for implementation:
     - Run @ctxk:plan:1-spec if Spec.md is missing
     - Run @ctxk:plan:2-research-tech if Tech.md is missing (includes Research.md creation)

     Implementation planning requires completed specification, research, and architecture.
     ```
     → END (exit with error)
   - Check for 🚨 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in all three files
   - If clarifications exist: WARN user to resolve them first

### Phase 3: Template Setup & Execution

4. **Copy Steps Template**
   ```bash
   cp ~/.ContextKit/Templates/Features/Steps.md [numbered-feature-directory]/Steps.md
   echo "✅ Copied implementation steps template"
   ```

5. **Execute Steps Template**
   - Use `Read` tool to read the copied Steps.md: `Read [numbered-feature-directory]/Steps.md`
   - Follow the **system instructions** section (boxed area) step by step
   - The template contains task generation logic with S### enumeration and parallel markers
   - Use tools (`Read`, `Edit`) as directed by the template instructions
   - **Template execution**: The copied Steps.md handles all task breakdown, dependency analysis, and parallel execution planning
   - **Progress tracking**: User can see checkboxes being completed in the copied file

6. **Extract and Resolve Clarification Points Interactively**
   - Use `Grep` tool to find clarification markers in Steps.md: `Grep "🚨 \\[NEEDS CLARIFICATION:" [numbered-feature-directory]/Steps.md`
   - If clarification points found:
     - Parse each clarification point to extract the specific question and line context
     - **FOR EACH CLARIFICATION (one at a time)**:
       - Present the specific question to user using User Input Format:
         ```
         ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
         ║ ❓ IMPLEMENTATION CLARIFICATION NEEDED
         ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
         ║
         ║ [Specific extracted question from 🚨 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]]
         ║
         ║ Please provide your answer to resolve this implementation detail:
         ```
       - **WAIT for user response** (execution MUST stop until user answers)
       - Use `Edit` tool to replace the 🚨 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] marker with the user's answer
       - Continue to next clarification point only after current one is resolved
     - After all clarifications resolved: confirm all markers removed from Steps.md

7. **Display Success Message** (see Success Messages section)

## Error Conditions

- **"Context.md not found"** → User must run `@ctxk:proj:init` to initialize ContextKit
- **"Prerequisites not complete"** → Must run `@ctxk:plan:1-spec` and `@ctxk:plan:2-research-tech` first
- **"Steps template not found"** → Ensure template files are available
- **"Unresolved clarifications exist"** → Resolve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in Spec.md and Tech.md first
- **"Template execution failed"** → Verify Steps.md template contains system instructions section


## Validation Gates

- Project Context.md exists (ContextKit project setup complete)?
- All prerequisites (Spec.md, Tech.md, Research.md) exist and are complete?
- No unresolved 🚨 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in all prerequisite files (Spec.md, Tech.md, Research.md)?
- Steps template copied to feature directory successfully?
- Template system instructions executed successfully?
- System instructions section removed from final Steps.md?
- Clarification points resolved interactively one at a time from Steps.md?
- User informed to review and commit implementation plan before proceeding?

## Integration Points

- **Global ContextKit**: Uses Templates/Features/Steps.md template for implementation task generation
- **Project Setup**: Requires Context.md created by @ctxk:proj:init for project detection and context
- **Template Execution**: Delegates all task logic to copied Steps.md template (follows init-workspace pattern)
- **Development Workflow**: Creates foundation for @ctxk:impl:start-working development execution phase
- **Team Collaboration**: Creates committed implementation plan for team review and development coordination
- **Git Integration**: Works within existing feature branch for systematic development workflow
- **Workspace Integration**: Template inherits coding standards and constitutional overrides from workspace Context.md

## Success Messages

### Implementation Steps Created Successfully
```
🎉 Implementation task breakdown created successfully!

✅ Created: [numbered-feature-directory]/Steps.md
✅ Generated S### task enumeration with parallel execution markers
✅ All mandatory phases completed with dependency analysis

✅ All implementation clarifications resolved interactively during generation

🔗 Next Steps:
1. Review [numbered-feature-directory]/Steps.md to ensure task breakdown is comprehensive
2. [If clarifications needed:] Edit the steps file to resolve marked implementation questions
3. When satisfied with the implementation plan: commit your changes with git
4. Run @ctxk:impl:start-working (in a new composer) to begin systematic development execution

💡 Implementation roadmap ready for development execution!
