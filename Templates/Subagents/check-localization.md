# Subagent: check-localization

## Purpose
Perform comprehensive localization audit with execution flow pattern to ensure iOS/macOS applications meet international and accessibility standards from day one.

## Context Requirements
- Project files (SwiftUI views, UIKit controllers, Core Data models)
- Current feature specifications and technical plans
- Target platforms (iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS)
- String Catalog files (.xcstrings)
- Localization configuration files

## Execution Flow (subagent)

### Phase 1: Project Build and String Catalog Update
1. Execute project build to ensure compilation
   → If build fails: ERROR "Fix compilation errors before localization audit"
   → Build command: `swift build` (Package) or `xcodebuild` (App)
2. Update String Catalog with latest strings
   → Force Xcode to regenerate .xcstrings files
   → Scan for new LocalizedStringKey usage
   → If String Catalog missing: WARN "Create String Catalog for localization"
3. Analyze generated string catalog content
   → Extract all LocalizedStringKey entries
   → Identify auto-generated vs custom string keys
   → Map strings to source code locations

### Phase 2: String Catalog Analysis and Enhancement
4. Review contextual comments in String Catalog
   → Compare Xcode auto-generated comments with usage context
   → Identify insufficient or misleading comments
   → Generate improved contextual descriptions for translators
5. Validate semantic localization keys
   → Check for descriptive keys vs raw text keys
   → Ensure keys follow semantic naming conventions
   → Flag hardcoded strings that should use LocalizedStringKey
6. Analyze pluralization rules implementation
   → Verify .stringsdict files or equivalent for plural forms
   → Check language-specific plural rules (English, German, Russian, etc.)
   → Validate count-based string variations

### Phase 3: Model Data and UI Localization Validation
7. Scan Core Data models for localization needs
   → Identify user-facing string attributes
   → Check for proper localization of model display names
   → Validate entity and attribute descriptions for localization
8. Review SwiftUI/UIKit views for localization patterns
   → Verify all user-facing text uses LocalizedStringKey
   → Check accessibility labels and hints for localization
   → Validate dynamic content localization (dates, numbers, currencies)
9. Audit region-specific formatters
   → Date and time formatting with locale awareness
   → Number formatting with proper separators and decimal points
   → Currency formatting with appropriate symbols and positions
   → Measurement unit conversions and display

### Phase 4: Constitutional Localizability Compliance
10. Apply constitutional principle: "Localizability from day one"
    → Every user-facing string must be localizable
    → No hardcoded text in user interface elements
    → Proper semantic key naming for translator context
11. Validate platform-appropriate localization patterns
    → iOS: String Catalog integration with Xcode
    → macOS: NSLocalizedString with proper bundle handling
    → Cross-platform: SwiftUI LocalizedStringKey consistency
12. Check accessibility localization compliance
    → VoiceOver labels and hints properly localized
    → accessibility identifiers language-neutral
    → Dynamic type support across languages

### Phase 5: Advanced Localization Patterns
13. Analyze RTL (Right-to-Left) language support
    → UI layout adaptability for Arabic, Hebrew
    → Text alignment and reading direction
    → Icon and image mirroring requirements
14. Review locale-specific UI adaptations
    → Text expansion considerations (German, Finnish)
    → Font and typography adjustments
    → Cultural color and symbol appropriateness
15. Validate localization testing infrastructure
    → Pseudolocalization setup for layout testing
    → Locale switching capabilities in development
    → Translation memory integration possibilities

# Localization Audit Report

## Project Build Status
✅ Build successful - String Catalog updated
❌ Build failed - Fix compilation errors first
⚠️  Build warnings - Review for localization impact

## String Catalog Analysis

### Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- **Hardcoded strings found**:
  - LoginView.swift:42: "Enter your password" → Use LocalizedStringKey("login.password.placeholder")
  - SettingsView.swift:15: "Settings" → Use LocalizedStringKey("settings.title")

- **Missing contextual comments**:
  - Key "button.save" needs context: "Save button in document editor toolbar"
  - Key "error.network" needs context: "Network connectivity error message for users"

### String Catalog Enhancements
- **Improved contextual descriptions**: 15 entries updated with translator-friendly context
- **Semantic key recommendations**:
  - "Welcome!" → "welcome.greeting.exclamation"
  - "Delete" → "action.delete.confirmation"
  - "5 items" → Use pluralization rules with .stringsdict

### Pluralization Analysis
- **Missing plural forms**:
  - "itemCount" needs .stringsdict for proper "1 item" vs "N items"
  - "dayCount" missing zero/one/other variations for German localization

- **Correct implementations**:
  - "notification.count" properly handles plural forms
  - "download.progress" uses count-aware string formatting

## Model Data Localization

### Core Data Models
- **User entity**: Display name needs localization for profile views
- **Project entity**: Status enumeration should use localized descriptions
- **Category entity**: Name attribute requires localization support

### Recommendations
- Add localized display name computed properties
- Implement NSLocalizedString for enum cases
- Consider localized entity descriptions for accessibility

## UI Component Analysis

### SwiftUI Views Compliance
✅ **Properly localized**:
- NavigationView titles using LocalizedStringKey
- Button labels with semantic keys
- Alert messages with contextual descriptions

⚠️ **Needs attention**:
- DatePicker format strings should use locale-aware formatting
- NumberFormatter lacking proper locale configuration
- Accessibility labels missing for custom UI elements

### Regional Formatter Validation
✅ **Correctly implemented**:
- DateFormatter with .current locale
- NumberFormatter with grouping separators
- RelativeDateTimeFormatter for time-sensitive content

❌ **Issues found**:
- Currency display hardcoded to "$" symbol
- Date format strings not respecting user preferences
- Measurement units not localized (miles vs kilometers)

## Constitutional Compliance Check

### Localizability from Day One ✅
- [x] All user-facing strings use LocalizedStringKey
- [x] String Catalog properly configured
- [x] No hardcoded UI text found
- [x] Semantic naming conventions followed
- [x] Translator context provided

### Platform-Appropriate Patterns ✅
- [x] iOS: String Catalog integration complete
- [x] SwiftUI: LocalizedStringKey usage consistent
- [x] Accessibility: VoiceOver labels localized
- [x] Dynamic Type: Works across languages

## Advanced Localization Readiness

### RTL Language Support
- **Layout adaptability**: SwiftUI automatic RTL support enabled
- **Text alignment**: Proper leading/trailing alignment usage
- **Icon mirroring**: System icons automatically mirror, custom icons need review

### Locale-Specific Considerations
- **Text expansion**: German translations may need 30-50% more space
- **Typography**: Font weight adjustments needed for CJK languages
- **Cultural appropriateness**: Color choices suitable for international markets

## Testing Infrastructure

### Pseudolocalization Setup
- **Recommendation**: Enable pseudolocalization in build settings
- **Purpose**: Test UI layout with expanded text before translation
- **Implementation**: Add "pseudo" locale for development testing

### Validation Checklist
